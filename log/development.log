Recently celebrating our 35th Anniversary, we continue to be a symbol of urban renewal and a source of pride for Marylanders. With a mission to inspire the world’s aquatic treasures, the Aquarium is consistently ranked as one of the nation’s top aquariums and has hosted over 51 million guests since opening. A study by the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development determined that the Aquarium annually generates nearly $220 million in revenues, 2,000 jobs, and $6.8 million in State and local taxes. It was also recently named one of Baltimore’s Best Places to Work! In addition to housing nearly 20,000 animals, we have countless science-based education programs and hands-on conservation projects spanning from right here in the Chesapeake Bay to abroad in Costa Rica. Once you head inside, The National Aquarium has the ability to transport you all over the world in a matter of hours to discover hundreds of incredible species. From the Freshwater Crocodile in our Australia: Wild Extremes exhibit all the way to a Largetooth Sawfish in the depths of Shark Alley. Recently winning top honors from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for outstanding design, exhibit innovation and guest engagement, we can’t forget about Living Seashore; an exhibit where guests can touch Atlantic stingrays, Horseshoe crabs, and even Moon jellies if they wish! It is a place for friends, family, and people from all walks of life to come and learn about the extraordinary creatures we share our planet with. Through education, research, conservation action and advocacy, the National Aquarium is truly pursuing a vision to change the way humanity cares for our ocean planet."], ["notes", "Remember to water the fish"], ["created_at", "2019-07-28 15:21:51.137919"], ["updated_at", "2019-07-28 15:21:51.137919"]]

Recently celebrating our 35th Anniversary, we continue to be a symbol of urban renewal and a source of pride for Marylanders. With a mission to inspire the world’s aquatic treasures, the Aquarium is consistently ranked as one of the nation’s top aquariums and has hosted over 51 million guests since opening. A study by the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development determined that the Aquarium annually generates nearly $220 million in revenues, 2,000 jobs, and $6.8 million in State and local taxes. It was also recently named one of Baltimore’s Best Places to Work! In addition to housing nearly 20,000 animals, we have countless science-based education programs and hands-on conservation projects spanning from right here in the Chesapeake Bay to abroad in Costa Rica. Once you head inside, The National Aquarium has the ability to transport you all over the world in a matter of hours to discover hundreds of incredible species. From the Freshwater Crocodile in our Australia: Wild Extremes exhibit all the way to a Largetooth Sawfish in the depths of Shark Alley. Recently winning top honors from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for outstanding design, exhibit innovation and guest engagement, we can’t forget about Living Seashore; an exhibit where guests can touch Atlantic stingrays, Horseshoe crabs, and even Moon jellies if they wish! It is a place for friends, family, and people from all walks of life to come and learn about the extraordinary creatures we share our planet with. Through education, research, conservation action and advocacy, the National Aquarium is truly pursuing a vision to change the way humanity cares for our ocean planet."], ["notes", "Remember to water the fish"], ["created_at", "2019-08-07 21:10:24.069587"], ["updated_at", "2019-08-07 21:10:24.069587"]]

Recently celebrating our 35th Anniversary, we continue to be a symbol of urban renewal and a source of pride for Marylanders. With a mission to inspire the world’s aquatic treasures, the Aquarium is consistently ranked as one of the nation’s top aquariums and has hosted over 51 million guests since opening. A study by the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development determined that the Aquarium annually generates nearly $220 million in revenues, 2,000 jobs, and $6.8 million in State and local taxes. It was also recently named one of Baltimore’s Best Places to Work! In addition to housing nearly 20,000 animals, we have countless science-based education programs and hands-on conservation projects spanning from right here in the Chesapeake Bay to abroad in Costa Rica. Once you head inside, The National Aquarium has the ability to transport you all over the world in a matter of hours to discover hundreds of incredible species. From the Freshwater Crocodile in our Australia: Wild Extremes exhibit all the way to a Largetooth Sawfish in the depths of Shark Alley. Recently winning top honors from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for outstanding design, exhibit innovation and guest engagement, we can’t forget about Living Seashore; an exhibit where guests can touch Atlantic stingrays, Horseshoe crabs, and even Moon jellies if they wish! It is a place for friends, family, and people from all walks of life to come and learn about the extraordinary creatures we share our planet with. Through education, research, conservation action and advocacy, the National Aquarium is truly pursuing a vision to change the way humanity cares for our ocean planet."], ["notes", "Remember to water the fish"], ["created_at", "2019-08-11 16:06:24.152442"], ["updated_at", "2019-08-11 16:06:24.152442"]]

Recently celebrating our 35th Anniversary, we continue to be a symbol of urban renewal and a source of pride for Marylanders. With a mission to inspire the world’s aquatic treasures, the Aquarium is consistently ranked as one of the nation’s top aquariums and has hosted over 51 million guests since opening. A study by the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development determined that the Aquarium annually generates nearly $220 million in revenues, 2,000 jobs, and $6.8 million in State and local taxes. It was also recently named one of Baltimore’s Best Places to Work! In addition to housing nearly 20,000 animals, we have countless science-based education programs and hands-on conservation projects spanning from right here in the Chesapeake Bay to abroad in Costa Rica. Once you head inside, The National Aquarium has the ability to transport you all over the world in a matter of hours to discover hundreds of incredible species. From the Freshwater Crocodile in our Australia: Wild Extremes exhibit all the way to a Largetooth Sawfish in the depths of Shark Alley. Recently winning top honors from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for outstanding design, exhibit innovation and guest engagement, we can’t forget about Living Seashore; an exhibit where guests can touch Atlantic stingrays, Horseshoe crabs, and even Moon jellies if they wish! It is a place for friends, family, and people from all walks of life to come and learn about the extraordinary creatures we share our planet with. Through education, research, conservation action and advocacy, the National Aquarium is truly pursuing a vision to change the way humanity cares for our ocean planet."], ["notes", "Remember to water the fish"], ["created_at", "2019-08-11 16:31:25.123367"], ["updated_at", "2019-08-11 16:31:25.123367"]]

Recently celebrating our 35th Anniversary, we continue to be a symbol of urban renewal and a source of pride for Marylanders. With a mission to inspire the world’s aquatic treasures, the Aquarium is consistently ranked as one of the nation’s top aquariums and has hosted over 51 million guests since opening. A study by the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development determined that the Aquarium annually generates nearly $220 million in revenues, 2,000 jobs, and $6.8 million in State and local taxes. It was also recently named one of Baltimore’s Best Places to Work! In addition to housing nearly 20,000 animals, we have countless science-based education programs and hands-on conservation projects spanning from right here in the Chesapeake Bay to abroad in Costa Rica. Once you head inside, The National Aquarium has the ability to transport you all over the world in a matter of hours to discover hundreds of incredible species. From the Freshwater Crocodile in our Australia: Wild Extremes exhibit all the way to a Largetooth Sawfish in the depths of Shark Alley. Recently winning top honors from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for outstanding design, exhibit innovation and guest engagement, we can’t forget about Living Seashore; an exhibit where guests can touch Atlantic stingrays, Horseshoe crabs, and even Moon jellies if they wish! It is a place for friends, family, and people from all walks of life to come and learn about the extraordinary creatures we share our planet with. Through education, research, conservation action and advocacy, the National Aquarium is truly pursuing a vision to change the way humanity cares for our ocean planet."], ["notes", "Remember to water the fish"], ["created_at", "2019-08-12 19:33:15.567847"], ["updated_at", "2019-08-12 19:33:15.567847"]]
